# rundyyy-skins
# my osu! skins (mixed skins and other people's skins. not a single one is my original creation)
skins that i use frequently and/or like a lot

# MAIN SKINS ARE LABELED

main nomod skin and main dt skin are always gonna be at the top. other than that, all skins are in alphabetical order, except for a few which may be in chronological order and other logical orders.

# INFO

i edit skins that i use A LOT (cursor, followpoints, etc.), so i may not update them here all the time. if you any questions about my skins, feel free to dm me on discord @rundyyy#1337 and i'll respond asap. i'll try to update this page (skin preview picture, dl links, etc.) as often as i can though.

also credit to joofi, I copied everything from him
